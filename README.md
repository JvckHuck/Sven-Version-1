# Sven-Version-1

This is my README.md for **Sven Verson 1**

Hello my name is Jackson Huckleberry and I am a sophomore at Wyomissing Area Junior Senior highschool. Lately I have been working on my Sven project for professor Minichs class. I have implicated several upgrades for Sven. These upgrades are descibed below and shown in my repl.it below.

While following my classmate Cooper McCaffrey in his help with our professor I worked on the coloring for Sven. The way I did this was use this link https://repl.it/@DavinceyRagaven/color to help me with the color scheme. The way i made Sven this colorful was using this code, \033[31**(there is no closed square bracket)**. There are only **30-46** different types of colors that are available. The way you would change the color is by chaning the number after the open square bracket. For example: **\033[31m** is red, **\033[32m]** is lime green, and **\033[33]** is orange. There are highlighted versions as well which are numbers **40-46**. You get the highlighted version by putting a 1; before the initial color **(30-39)**. The code for example: **\033[1;31** which would show a red highlight, **\033[1;32** would show a green highlight, and **\033[1;33** would show an orange highlight.
